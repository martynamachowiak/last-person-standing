        Each week all entrants must pick a Premier League team to win their game.
        If entrants team win, they’re through to next round. Lose or draw, and the entrant is out of the competition.
        Entrants must notify the organiser by (Time, Date) of their Selection. If you do not select a team by the deadline, or in the event of you nominating a team that you have already used, you will be assigned the lowest alphabetic ordered team in the table, that you have not previously selected.
        You cannot select the same team to win more than once during the competition.
        Once you have chosen a team, you cannot change it.
        If a match involving your Selection is postponed (after you have made your selection), you will continue to the next round. However, that team will no longer be available for you to pick in the following rounds.
        If fewer than five entrants remain standing and they are eliminated in the same week, the prize fund will be shared equally between them.
        If two or more entrants remain standing after the final game of the season, then the prize fund will be equally shared between them.
